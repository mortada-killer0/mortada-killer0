          <h1>A Perfect Alternative to Windows.</h1>
          <p>AluminumOS is a linux distro but unlike others. It has its own desktop, apps, etc.
          <br>It's designed to support all CPUs and Devices in mind.
          <br>And very safe for normal users to the point you can let a child use it and it'll stay in one piece.
          <br>And optimized and designed for all users. Your grandma can use it ;)</p>

          <h1>Always Help Charities.</h1>
          <p>Help small countries graduate and make their people able to access everything.
          <br>They have had the worst times and i really want them to be safe.
          <br>By the way. Make sure you didn't stumble on a scam website pretending to help charity.
          <br>If you did help/donate to charity. Thank you so much &lt;3</p>
